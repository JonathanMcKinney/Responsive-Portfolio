                <p class="bio">I grew up outside of Atlanta in Marietta, GA, until moving to Boone, NC, for college in
                    2008. I attended Appalachian State University graduating in 2013 with a degree in Environmental
                    Economics and Policy and Sustainable Development.</p>

                <p class="bio">After graduation I moved to Portland, OR. I was the manager and mechanic for a bikeshop.
                    I spent my free time hiking and exploring the Pacific Northwest. I continue to spend most of my
                    free time riding bikes, rock climbing, hiking, and rambling around outside.</p>

                <p class="bio">In 2016, I moved to Charlotte to be near friends. I worked for a mortgage company for
                    two and a half years. I had tried to teach myself web development several times, but work always
                    got in the way. I wasn't able to commit the time to reinforce what I was teaching myself, and I
                    decided it was time for a change. In October of 2018 I registered for a coding bootcamp through UNC
                    Charlotte and Trilogy.</p>
